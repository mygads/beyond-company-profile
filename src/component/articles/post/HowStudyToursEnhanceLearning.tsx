                            Learning isn't confined to four walls—study tours provide students with immersive experiences that deepen
                            their understanding of subjects while fostering independence and cultural awareness. But how exactly do they
                            enhance education?

                            Study tours bridge the gap between theory and practice. Whether it's visiting a historical site, a
